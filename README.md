Python script to sync folders

Source and replica paths are given by the user, along with where they want to store the log file and how often (in minutes) they want the synchronization to happen.

For now, the script needs to be running in the background for the synchronization to happen. I thought of adding a task to windows task scheduler through python, but didn't want to build clutter.
